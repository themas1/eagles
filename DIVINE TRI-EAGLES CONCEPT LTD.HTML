            Honeybee hives are constructed by worker bees 
            and serve as their home, a place to store honey 
            and pollen, and a breeding ground for new generations.
             These hives are typically made of wax secreted by the
              worker bees and arranged into hexagonal cells to form
               honeycombs. Wild honeybees may choose natural
                cavities like hollow trees, rock crevices, or 
                caves, while domesticated bees may be housed in
                 human-made structures like wooden boxes with frames
                  for honeycombs

            A bee sting is the wound and pain caused by the stinger 
            of a female bee puncturing skin. Bee stings differ from
             insect bites, with the venom of stinging insects having 
             considerable chemical variation. The reaction of a person
              to a bee sting may vary according to the bee species.
               While bee stinger venom is slightly acidic and causes 
               only mild pain in most people,allergic reactions may
                occur in people with allergies to venom components
